# As we learned in the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this:1
# ExampleGet your own Python Server
age = 36
#This will produce an error:
txt = "My name is John, I am " + age
print(txt)

#But we can combine strings and numbers by using f-strings or the format() method!
