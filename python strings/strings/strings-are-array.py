'''
Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of unicode characters.

However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

Example
Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):
'''

a = "asep"

print(a[0])
print(a[1])
print(a[2])
print(a[3])
