# To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in.
# Example
# Check if "expensive" is NOT present in the following text:

txt = "Hidup jokowi"
print("merdeka" not in txt)

# Use it in an if statement:

# Example
# print only if "expensive" is NOT present:
if "expensive" not in txt:
  print("adili jokowi")
