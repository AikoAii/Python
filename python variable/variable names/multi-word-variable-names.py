#Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
# There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

#Camel case 
#Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariable = "asep"

#pascal case
#Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariable = "asep"

#Snake case
#Each word is separated by an underscore character:
my_variable = "asep"
