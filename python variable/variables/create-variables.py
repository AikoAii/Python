# Variables are containers for storing data values.

#creating variable:
#Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

x = 5 #type int
y = "Cihuyy" #type str
print(x)
print(y)

#Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
