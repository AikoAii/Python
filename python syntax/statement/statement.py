#A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

# In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

# The following statement prints the text "Python is fun!" to the screen:
print("Python is shheshh") 
#In Python, a statement usually ends when the line ends. You do not need to use a semicolon (;) like in many other programming languages (for example, Java or C).
