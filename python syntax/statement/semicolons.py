#Semicolons are optional in Python. You can write multiple statements on one line by separating them with ; but this is rarely used because it makes it hard to read:
print("Hi"); print("My name is Aiko"); print("Cihuy")

#However, if you put two statements on the same line without a separator (newline or ;), Python will give an error:
#example
# print("Python is fun!") print("Really!")
