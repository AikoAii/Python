Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

Operator	Name	     Example	Try it
==	        Equal	     x == y	
!=	        Not equal	 x != y	
>	        Greater than	x > y	
<	        Less than	x < y	
>=	        Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	        Less than or equal to	x <= y

#Comparison operators return True or False based on the comparison:
x = 5
y = 3
print(x == y)
print(x != y)
print(x > y)
print(x < y)
print(x >= y)
print(x <= y)
