# The ^ operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if only one is 1, otherwise (if both are 1 or both are 0) it is set to 0:

print(6 ^ 3)
# The binary representation of 6 is 0110
# The binary representation of 3 is 0011

# Then the ^ operator compares the bits and returns 0101, which is 5 in decimal.
